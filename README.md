# --In Progess-- Analysis of Social Media Data about Singapore

Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-cultural society with 4 main languages. This repository documents the journey to derive insights from textual social media data about Singapore, from *Twitter* and *Instagram*, with the following potential areas of exploration:

1) Trending topics

2) Sentiment Analysis on trending topics as well as internal vs external data

3) Named-Entity Recognition

4) Proportion of languages used


As no datasets on social media data about Singapore are publicly available, data will be mined from the aforementioned social media platforms using AWS before being used for analysis. This project will be segmented into 4 parts:

1) Data mining using AWS

2) Data cleaning & labelling using NLTK and spaCy

3) Building/Training of various AI Models

4) Extraction and visualization of results


The following graph showcases the overall approach for this project:
